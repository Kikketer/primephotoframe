# Prime Photo Frame
A way to use your useless android tablet as a photo frame for Amazon Prime Photos.

## Update
I've abandoned this project after about a day of development.  While I was able to get the application looking reasonable in a record amount of time the hurdles involved in getting the Amazon login working and getting access to the Prime Photos (in amazon drive).

I continue to use the web as the go-to application platform.  It's actually possible!
